1. Regex within Boolean: Allow terms within the boolean query to be regex patterns (e.g., /error\d+/ AND "database"). This requires modifying the parser or the evaluator to detect and handle regex literals differently from simple string literals.
2. Proximity Search: Implement operators like NEAR or WITHIN (e.g., "error" NEAR/5 "database"). This requires much more complex evaluation logic, tracking term positions.
3. Structured Query Builder UI: Replace the text input with a visual builder for users less comfortable with boolean syntax.

4. Provide a documentation about the program.
