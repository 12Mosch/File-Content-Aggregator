# Search Algorithm Optimization Plan

This document outlines the plan for optimizing the search algorithm, particularly focusing on the NEAR operator implementation, based on the bottlenecks identified through profiling.

## Priority Areas

The following areas are listed in order of priority, based on their impact on performance and the effort required to implement optimizations.

### 1. Fuzzy Search Optimization

**Problem:** Fuzzy search is the most significant bottleneck in the NEAR operator, consuming substantial resources with often minimal benefit.

**Metrics:**
- Total time: 157.48ms (highest among all phases)
- Average time per operation: 0.36ms
- Success rate: Very low (often 0%)

**Optimization Strategies:**
1. **Make fuzzy search optional for NEAR operations**
   - Add a configuration option to disable fuzzy search in NEAR operations
   - Default to disabled for performance-critical scenarios

2. **Implement smart triggering for fuzzy search**
   - Only use fuzzy search when exact match fails and term length is sufficient (e.g., > 3 characters)
   - Implement a confidence threshold to skip fuzzy search for unlikely matches

3. **Optimize the fuzzy search algorithm**
   - Evaluate alternative fuzzy matching algorithms with better performance characteristics
   - Implement early termination for unlikely matches
   - Consider using a more efficient implementation of Fuse.js or an alternative library

**Expected Outcome:**
- 50-70% reduction in NEAR operator execution time
- Improved overall search performance
- Minimal impact on search quality for most use cases

### 2. Caching Mechanism Improvements

**Problem:** The current caching mechanism has a very low hit rate (often 0%), indicating ineffective caching.

**Metrics:**
- Cache hit rate: 0%
- Cache misses: 100% of requests

**Optimization Strategies:**
1. **Improve cache key generation**
   - Implement more effective hashing for cache keys
   - Consider content-based hashing for better uniqueness

2. **Optimize cache size and eviction policy**
   - Increase cache size for frequently accessed patterns
   - Implement a more sophisticated eviction policy (e.g., LFU instead of LRU)
   - Add cache warming for common search patterns

3. **Implement multi-level caching**
   - Add a persistent cache for frequently used search patterns
   - Implement in-memory caching for session-specific patterns

**Expected Outcome:**
- Increase cache hit rate to at least 30-40%
- Reduce redundant calculations
- Improve overall search performance by 20-30%

### 3. Term Indices Calculation Optimization

**Problem:** Term indices calculation is a fundamental operation that takes significant time.

**Metrics:**

   - Implement a sliding window approach for NEAR operations

**Expected Outcome:**
- Reduced memory usage by 30-50%
- More stable memory usage patterns
- Improved performance for large files

### 5. Word Boundary Calculation Optimization

**Problem:** Word boundary calculation takes a non-trivial amount of time and is performed frequently.
