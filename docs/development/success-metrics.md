## Next Steps

To fully achieve our performance goals, we need to focus on:

1. **Search Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement more efficient search algorithms
   - Optimize file reading and processing
   - Improve parallelization of search operations

2. **Memory Usage Optimization**:
   - Implement more aggressive memory management
   - Optimize data structures for lower memory footprint
   - Improve garbage collection strategies

## Conclusion

We have made significant progress in improving code quality and developer experience, but we still have work to do to achieve our performance improvement goals. The next phase of the refactoring plan should focus on search algorithm optimization and memory management in file processing.
