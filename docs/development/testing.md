# Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the File Content Aggregator application.

## Testing Categories

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify that individual components and functions work as expected in isolation.

- **UI Components**

  - [x] ErrorBoundary component
  - [x] HighlightMatches component
  - [x] HTML highlighting utilities
  - [x] Search worker
  - [x] File operations

- **Search Functionality**

  - [x] Search term parsing
  - [x] Search term evaluation
  - [x] File filtering
  - [x] Regex pattern validation
  - [x] Regex pattern matching
  - [x] NEAR operator parsing
  - [x] NEAR operator evaluation
  - [x] Fuzzy search matching
  - [x] Fuzzy search configuration
  - [x] Whole word matching

- **Services and Utilities**
  - [x] Logger service
  - [x] LRU Cache
  - [x] Worker Pool
  - [x] Search Service
  - [x] Error Handling Service

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly.

- **Search Pipeline**

  - [x] Regex in search pipeline
  - [x] NEAR in search pipeline
  - [x] Fuzzy search in search pipeline
  - [x] Whole word matching in search pipeline
  - [x] Highlighting in search results

- **UI Integration**
  - [x] UI components interaction
  - [x] Settings UI
  - [x] Localization
  - [x] Accessibility
  - [ ] Error handling and recovery

### Performance Tests

Performance tests verify that the application meets performance requirements.

  - [x] End-to-end search performance
  - [x] Optimized search performance
  - [x] File processing memory usage
  - [x] Memory leak detection
  - [x] UI performance

## Test Implementation Status

### Completed Tests

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
npm run test tests/path/to/test.ts
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Results

Test results are stored in the following locations:

- Coverage reports: `coverage/` directory
- Performance test results: `performance-results/` directory
