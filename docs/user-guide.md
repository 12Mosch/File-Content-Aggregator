![Main window of the application](./Screenshots/AppScreenshot.png)

1.  **Header:** Contains the application title and buttons to access Search History (üïí) and Settings (‚öôÔ∏è).
2.  **Search Form:** This is where you define all your search criteria.
3.  **Results Area:** Displays the progress bar during a search and the search results afterwards.

## Searching for Files

The core of the application is the Search Form. Fill in the relevant fields to define what and where you want to search.

### Search Form Fields

- **Search Paths:**
  - Enter the full paths to the directories you want to search in.
  - You can enter multiple paths, separated by a **new line** or a **comma**.
  - _Example:_
    ```
    C:\Users\Me\Documents
    D:\Projects\ProjectA\src, D:\Logs
    /home/user/code
    ```
- **File Extensions:**
  - Specify the file types to include in the search.
  - Enter extensions **without the leading dot**, separated by commas.
  - _Example:_ `txt, log, ts, cs, json, md`
- **Exclude Files (Glob/Regex):**
  - Specify patterns for filenames to _exclude_ from the search. Enter one pattern per line.
  - Supports **glob patterns** (like `*.tmp`, `temp*`, `?cache`) and **regular expressions** (enclosed in slashes, e.g., `/\.(bak|old)$/i`).
  - _Example:_
    ```
    *.tmp
    package-lock.json
    /^\._/  # Exclude macOS metadata files
    ```
- **Exclude Folders (Wildcards):**
  - Specify patterns for folder names to _exclude_ entire directories and their contents. Enter one pattern per line.
  - Uses wildcard matching (`*` matches any sequence of characters, `?` matches a single character).
  - **Match Mode:** Select how the pattern should match folder names within the path:
    - `Segment Contains Pattern`: Excludes if _any part_ of a folder name matches (e.g., `cache` excludes `__pycache__`, `.cache`).
    - `Segment Exactly Matches Pattern`: Excludes only if the folder name is an exact match (e.g., `node_modules`).
    - `Segment Starts With Pattern`: Excludes if a folder name starts with the pattern (e.g., `.git` excludes `.git`, `.github`).
    - `Segment Ends With Pattern`: Excludes if a folder name ends with the pattern (e.g., `_backup`).
  - _Example (using 'Contains' mode):_
    ```
    node_modules
    .git
    bin
    obj
    dist
    *cache*
    ```
- **Max Search Depth:**
  - Optionally limit how many levels deep the search should go within subdirectories.
  - Leave blank for unlimited depth. Enter `1` to search only the top-level directory, `2` for the top level and its immediate subdirectories, etc.
- **Content Query:**
  - Use the **Query Builder** (see next section) to define criteria for searching _inside_ file content. Leave this empty if you only want to search by filename/path/metadata.
- **Modified After / Before:**
  - Optionally filter files based on their last modification date.
  - Click the input field or the calendar icon (üóìÔ∏è) to open the date picker.
  - You can navigate months/years using the arrows (`<`, `>`) or double arrows (`<<`, `>>`). Click the Month or Year in the header to select from a list.
  - You can also type the date directly into the input field using `DD.MM.YYYY` format (e.g., `31.12.2023`). Press Enter to confirm the typed date.
  - Click the `X` button to clear a selected date.
- **Min Size / Max Size:**
  - Optionally filter files based on their size.
  - Enter a numeric value and select the unit (Bytes, KB, MB, GB).

### Content Query Builder

This powerful tool lets you define complex search criteria for the _content_ of the files. If you add any conditions here, only files matching _both_ the form filters (path, extension, date, etc.) _and_ the content query will be included in the results preview.

- **Adding Conditions/Groups:**
  - Click `+ Condition` to add a new search term/rule.
  - Click `+ Group` to add a nested group, allowing you to create more complex logic (e.g., `(TermA AND TermB) OR TermC`).
- **Operators (AND/OR):**
  - Each group has an operator (`AND` or `OR`) that defines how its direct children (conditions or subgroups) are combined.
  - `AND`: _All_ conditions/subgroups within the group must be true.
  - `OR`: _At least one_ condition/subgroup within the group must be true.
- **Condition Types:**
  - **Term:** Finds simple text.
    - Enter the text directly (e.g., `database connection`).
    - Use quotes (`"`) if your text includes spaces or keywords like `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `NEAR` (e.g., `"user OR admin"`).
    - The **Case-Sensitive** checkbox _below_ the builder applies _only_ to these simple `Term` conditions.
  - **Regex:** Finds text matching a regular expression pattern.
    - Enter the pattern between slashes (`/pattern/flags`).
    - _Example:_ `/error\d+/i` finds "error" followed by one or more digits, ignoring case.
    - Common flags: `i` (ignore case), `g` (global - usually implicit in search).
  - **NEAR:** Finds two terms within a specified word distance of each other.
    - Syntax: `NEAR(term1, term2, distance)`
    - `term1`, `term2`: Can be simple text (quoted if needed) or a `/regex/`.
    - `distance`: The maximum number of words allowed between the end of the first term and the start of the second term.
    - _Example:_ `NEAR("user login", /fail(ed|ure)/i, 10)` finds "user login" within 10 words of "failed" or "failure" (case-insensitive).
- **Removing Items:** Click the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) next to any condition or group to remove it.

### Running and Cancelling Searches

- **Start:** Once your criteria are set, click the **Search Files** button.
- **Progress:** A progress bar will appear, showing the number of files processed and the current status.
- **Cancel:** While the search is running (`Searching...` button state), a **Cancel Search** button will appear next to it. Click this to request the search to stop early. The progress bar will indicate cancellation, and the results shown will be up to the point of cancellation.

## Understanding Results

After a search completes (or is cancelled), the results area will update.

### Results Summary

Above the results display, you'll see a summary:

- **Files Found (Initial):** The total number of files matching your path and extension filters _before_ content/metadata filtering.
- **Files Processed:** The number of files whose content or metadata was actually checked against your criteria.
- **File Read Errors:** The number of files that couldn't be read due to permissions or other issues (details shown in the error section below the form if any occurred).
- **Total Files/Lines:** The count of items currently displayed in the results view (changes based on View Mode and filtering).

### View Modes (Text Block vs. Tree View)

Use the radio buttons above the results to switch views:

- **Text Block:**
  - Shows the concatenated content of all files that matched your _content query_.
  - If no content query was used, this view might be empty or show all content depending on implementation details.
  - Useful for quickly scanning matched content together.
- **Tree View:**
  - Lists _all_ files that were processed (passed initial path/extension/metadata filters).
  - Click the arrow (`‚ñ∂`/`‚ñº`) or the file path to expand/collapse an item.
  - **Matched Files:** Show a preview of their content (syntax highlighted where possible). If content is long, a "Show More" button appears.
  - **Non-Matching Files:** Show only the file path (content preview is hidden).
  - **Files with Read Errors:** Show the file path and the specific error (e.g., "Permission Denied").
  - **Copy Icon:** Click the copy icon (üìÑ) in the header of an expanded item to copy _only that file's_ full content to the clipboard.

### Filtering Results

- Use the **Filter Results** input box above the results display to quickly filter the _currently displayed_ results in either view mode.
- Check the **Case-Sensitive** box next to it to make the filter match case.
- This filter operates _only_ on the results already found by the main search; it doesn't perform a new file system search.

### Copying and Exporting Results

Below the results display area, you'll find options to copy or save the results:

- **Copy to Clipboard:** Copies the _entire content_ currently shown in the **Text Block** view to your clipboard.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** If the total result size is very large, the content might be truncated by your operating system's clipboard limits. A warning message will appear above the results if this is likely. Use the export option for large results.
- **Export Format:** Select the desired format for exporting the results:
  - **CSV:** Creates a Comma Separated Value file with columns for FilePath, Status (Matched, Read Error, Not Matched), and Details (content or error message). Suitable for spreadsheets.
  - **JSON:** Creates a JSON file containing an array of all processed files, including their path, content (if matched), and any read errors. Suitable for programmatic use.
  - **Markdown:** Creates a Markdown file with each file listed under a heading, followed by its content or error message in a code block. Suitable for documentation or readable reports.
- **Save Results As...:** Opens a system dialog allowing you to save the data for _all processed files_ (the data underlying the Tree View) to a file in the selected **Export Format**. This is the recommended way to export large or structured results.

## Search History

Click the history icon (üïí) in the header to open the Search History modal.

- **View:** See a list of your past searches, sorted by time (most recent first) and favorites.
- **Load:** Click the "Load" button on an entry to repopulate the Search Form with that search's parameters.
- **Filter:** Use the filter input at the top of the modal to quickly find past searches by name, path, query terms, etc.
- **Name/Favorite:**
  - Click the star (‚≠ê) to toggle an entry as a favorite (favorites appear at the top).
  - Click the displayed name (or "Untitled Search") to edit and give the search a memorable name. Press Enter or click the checkmark (‚úì) to save, or Escape/X to cancel editing.
- **Delete:** Click the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) to remove a single entry.
- **Clear All:** Click the "Clear All History" button (requires confirmation) to permanently delete all saved searches.

## Settings

Click the settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the header to open the Application Settings modal.

- **Interface Language:** Choose your preferred language for the application's interface.
- **Theme:** Select your preferred visual theme:
  - `Light`: Light background, dark text.
  - `Dark`: Dark background, light text.
  - `System Default`: Automatically matches your operating system's light/dark mode setting.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Results Found:**
  - Double-check your **Search Paths** are correct and accessible.
  - Verify your **File Extensions** are correct (no dots, comma-separated).
  - Make sure your **Exclude** patterns aren't accidentally excluding the files you want.
  - Simplify your **Content Query** or remove it temporarily to see if files are found based on path/extension alone. Check query syntax carefully (quotes, slashes for regex, NEAR format).
  - Ensure **Date** and **Size** filters aren't too restrictive.
- **Permission Denied Errors:** The application needs read access to the directories and files you are searching. If searching system-protected areas, you might need to adjust folder permissions (consult your OS documentation). Avoid running the application with elevated privileges (like `sudo` or "Run as Administrator") unless absolutely necessary and you understand the security implications.
- **Search is Very Slow:**
  - Searching large directories (like `C:\` or `/`) or directories with millions of files will take time.
  - Complex regular expressions in the content query can be slow.
  - Searching very deep directory structures can be slow; try using **Max Depth**.
  - Use **Exclude Folders** effectively (e.g., `node_modules`, build output folders, backup folders).
- **UI Glitches / Freezes:** Try restarting the application. If the problem persists, report it.
- **Export Fails:** Ensure you have write permissions for the location where you are trying to save the file. Check for error messages displayed by the application.
